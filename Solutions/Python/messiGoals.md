## Problem

Use variables to find the sum of the goals Messi scored in 3 competitions

Information
Messi goal scoring statistics:

Competition Goals
La Liga 43
Champions League 10
Copa del Rey 5

Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:
la_liga_goals
champions_league_goals
copa_del_rey_goals

Create a fourth variable named total_goals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year.

**Solution 1:**

```python
la_liga_goals = 43
champions_league_goals = 10
copa_del_rey_goals = 5

total_goals = la_liga_goals + champions_league_goals + copa_del_rey_goals
```
